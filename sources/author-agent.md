# ArchAstro Agent Authoring

Create or update the config files for a config-driven ArchAstro agent before deployment.

This skill assumes the ArchAstro CLI is already installed and authenticated. {{ASSUME_INSTALLED}}

## Always Start with State

Every invocation must begin by understanding the current project state:

```
archastro auth status
```

If the user is in a repo, inspect whether a `configs/` directory already exists and whether the agent already has Script or AgentTemplate files.

## Routing

### CLI not installed or too old

Before any authoring work, verify the CLI:

- Read `plugin-compatibility.json` from the plugin root.
- Prefer `plugins.archastro.minimumCliVersion`, fall back to the top-level `minimumCliVersion`.
- Run `archastro --version`. If missing or older than the resolved minimum, {{INSTALL_ROUTE}}.
- If authentication or app selection is missing, {{AUTH_ROUTE}}.

### Local config directory not initialized

If the user doesn't have a `configs/` directory set up yet, route to the `manage-configs` skill first. That skill owns `archastro init --enable-configs`, local file layout, and the sync/deploy workflow.

### User wants to author or modify agent configs

1. **Start from CLI-backed templates, not memory**:
   - For new config objects, use:
     ```
     archastro describe configsample <Kind>
     ```
   - For Script configs, always use:
     ```
     archastro describe scriptdocs
     archastro describe configsample Script
     ```
     The script docs are the live source of truth. Do not invent or paraphrase the language from memory.

2. **Use the standard config-driven model**:
   - Script logic lives in `kind: Script` configs.
   - Agent behavior lives in an `AgentTemplate`.
   - Custom tools should use `kind: custom`, `handler_type: script`, and `config_ref` pointing at Script configs.
   - When creating configs outside a project directory, use `-f` to read from a file:
     ```
     archastro create config -k AgentTemplate -f configs/agents/my-agent.yaml
     ```

3. **Validate early**:
   ```
   archastro validate config -k <Kind> -f <path>
   ```
   Run validation before deploy whenever the user changes Script or template files.

4. **Deploy through the normal flow after authoring**:
   - If the agent has Script configs or other supporting files, sync them first:
     ```
     archastro deploy configs
     ```
     This pushes local config files (Scripts, templates) but does not create agents.
     Skip this step if the agent only has a single AgentTemplate file — `deploy agent` handles its own config upload.
   - Then provision the agent from its template:
     ```
     archastro deploy agent <yaml-file>
     ```
     This uploads the template config and creates the agent with its routines, tools, and installations.
   - **Important:** `deploy configs` and `deploy agent` are different commands.
     Use `deploy configs` to sync a directory of config files; use `deploy agent` to create an agent from a template.

## Authoring Rules

### Script configs

- **Load the `build-script` skill for detailed script authoring guidance**, including syntax examples, common mistakes, and the validation/test/deploy workflow.
- Treat the script language as a functional expression language, not a general-purpose imperative language.
- Use `archastro describe scriptdocs` for exact syntax and available namespaces.
- If a script fails validation, prefer rewriting toward the sample/reference instead of trial-and-error improvisation.

### Routine configs inside templates

- Scheduled routines need both:
  - `schedule: "<cron>"`
  - `event_type: schedule.cron`
- Do not put schedules under nested `event_config.schedule`.
- To discover valid event types and their payload schemas:
  ```
  archastro list events
  archastro describe event <event-name>
  ```
  The payload schema from `describe event` shows what `$` contains in the routine's script handler.

### Config references

- Prefer human-readable `config_ref` values that match deployed config lookup keys.
- Do not convert refs to raw `cfg_...` IDs unless explicitly debugging a broken environment.

### Environment variables

- For org users, prefer org-scoped environment variables when they are sufficient for the agent's needs.
- Do not default users into app-scoped env-var flows unless the use case truly requires app scope.

## Recovery Rules

- If the user asks for a brand-new Script and the language shape is unclear, run `archastro describe scriptdocs` before drafting.
- If validation fails, surface the exact failing field or syntax problem. Do not immediately switch to lower-level provisioning commands.
- If the user asks to "just create the agent" while configs are still incomplete, finish authoring and validation first, then route to `deploy-agent`.

## Command Conventions

- All config commands are **verb-first**: `archastro list configs`, `archastro create config`, `archastro deploy configs`, `archastro sync configs`, `archastro validate config`, etc.
- There is no `archastro configs` namespace. Do not use `archastro configs <verb>` — always put the verb first.

## Response Rules

- Do not inspect or edit credential files directly — use the CLI only.
- Do not ask the user to pick raw subcommands when intent is clear.
- Keep responses concise and operational.
- Prefer the golden path over fallback commands.
