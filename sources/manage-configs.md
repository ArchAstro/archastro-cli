# ArchAstro Local Config Management

Set up and manage a local `configs/` directory for editing agent configs as files, syncing with the server, and deploying changes.

This skill assumes the ArchAstro CLI is already installed and authenticated. {{ASSUME_INSTALLED}}

## What is Local Config Management?

Instead of creating and editing configs one-by-one through CLI CRUD commands, you can manage them as local files in a `configs/` directory. This enables:
- **Edit configs in your editor** with syntax highlighting and version control
- **Batch deploy** all changes in dependency order
- **Sync** server configs down to local files
- **Browser editor** for visual editing of individual configs

The CLI tracks the mapping between local files and server configs in a manifest file.

## Always Start with State

Every invocation must begin by understanding the current project state:

```
archastro auth status
ls configs/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No configs directory"
```

Determine:
- Does a `configs/` directory already exist?
- Is the user starting a new project or working with an existing one?
- Do they want to pull configs from the server or push local changes?

## Routing

### CLI not installed or too old

Before any config work, verify the CLI:

- Read `plugin-compatibility.json` from the plugin root.
- Prefer `plugins.archastro.minimumCliVersion`, fall back to the top-level `minimumCliVersion`.
- Run `archastro --version`. If missing or older than the resolved minimum, {{INSTALL_ROUTE}}.
- If authentication or app selection is missing, {{AUTH_ROUTE}}.

### User wants to set up a configs directory for the first time

1. **Initialize the config directory**:
   ```
   archastro init --enable-configs
   ```
   This enables local config management and creates the configured `configs/` directory if needed. It does not automatically sync remote configs; use `archastro sync configs` next when you want local files.

2. **Explain the layout**: After init, the directory looks like:
   ```
   configs/
   ├── .archastro-manifest.json    # Maps local files to server configs (do not edit manually)
   ├── agents/                     # AgentTemplate configs
   ├── skills/                     # Skill bundles
   ├── scripts/                    # Script configs
   ├── workflows/                  # Workflow configs
   └── ...                         # Other config kinds
   ```

   Managed virtual paths also follow these prefixes on the server: `skills/`, `scripts/`, and `workflows/`.

3. **Offer next steps**: Ask if the user wants to create a new config (`archastro describe configsample <Kind>`) or sync existing configs from the server.

### User wants to pull configs from the server

Sync server configs to local files:
```
archastro sync configs
```

This downloads all configs for the current app — including skills, scripts, and workflows — and writes them as local files in the correct directories. The manifest tracks the file-to-config mapping.

After syncing, the directory structure reflects server state:
```
configs/
├── agents/                     # AgentTemplate configs (.yaml)
├── skills/my-skill/            # Skill bundles (SKILL.md + supporting files)
├── scripts/                    # Script configs (.agentscript)
├── workflows/                  # Workflow configs (.json)
└── ...                         # Other config kinds
```

You can then edit any file locally and run `archastro deploy configs` to push changes back.

### User wants to create a new config locally

For **scripts**, **skills**, and **workflows**, prefer the dedicated commands or create files directly in the correct directory:

- **Script**: Write a `.agentscript` file in `configs/scripts/`:
  ```
  configs/scripts/my-script.agentscript
  ```
- **Skill**: Create a `SKILL.md` (with frontmatter) in `configs/skills/<slug>/`:
  ```
  configs/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
  configs/skills/my-skill/prompts/greeting.liquid   # optional supporting files
  ```
- **Workflow**: Write a `.json` file in `configs/workflows/`:
  ```
  configs/workflows/my-workflow.json
  ```

For **other config kinds** (AgentTemplate, Persona, etc.), get a sample:
```
archastro list configkinds
archastro describe configsample <Kind> --to-file ./configs/<category>/<name>.yaml
```

You can also use the browser editor:
```
archastro edit config ./configs/<category>/<name>.yaml
```

### User wants to validate local configs

Validate a specific config file:
```
archastro validate config -k <Kind> -f ./configs/<category>/<name>.yaml
```

For scripts specifically, use the dedicated validator:
```
archastro validate script --file ./configs/scripts/my-script.agentscript
```

### User wants to deploy local changes

Push all local config changes to the server:
```
archastro deploy configs
```

This:
- Compares local files against the manifest
- Uploads new and changed configs in dependency order
- Updates the manifest with new server IDs

#### Managed directory conventions

`deploy configs` enforces conventions for three managed directories:

| Directory | Convention |
|-----------|-----------|
| `skills/<slug>/` | All files become `File` kind. `SKILL.md` is the root — name and description are extracted from its YAML frontmatter. Other files (`.liquid`, `.yaml`, `.js`, etc.) become supporting skill files. |
| `scripts/` | Only `.agentscript` files and `.yaml`/`.json` with `kind: Script` are allowed. Other file types are rejected. |
| `workflows/` | Only `.json` files and `.yaml` with a `Workflow*` kind are allowed. Other file types are rejected. |

Files outside these directories use standard kind inference from file extension or YAML content.

**Important**: `deploy configs` syncs config files only. It does not create agents. To provision an agent from a template, use `archastro deploy agent <file>` separately.

### User wants to move or rename a config file

If a local config file is moved or renamed:
```
archastro update configpath <old-path> <new-path>
```

This updates the manifest mapping without affecting the server config.

### User has manifest issues

If the manifest gets out of sync:
```
archastro validate configmanifest
```

This re-normalizes the manifest and resolves any inconsistencies.

## Typical Workflows

### New project from scratch
```
archastro init --enable-configs
archastro describe configsample AgentTemplate --to-file ./configs/agents/my-agent.yaml
# Edit the file...
archastro validate config -k AgentTemplate -f ./configs/agents/my-agent.yaml
archastro deploy configs
archastro deploy agent ./configs/agents/my-agent.yaml
```

### Create a skill via local files
```
archastro init --enable-configs
mkdir -p configs/skills/my-skill
# Write SKILL.md with frontmatter (name, description)
# Add supporting files (prompts, references, etc.)
archastro deploy configs
# Skill is now visible via: archastro list skills
```

### Create a script via local files
```
archastro init --enable-configs
# Write script source directly
echo 'println("hello")' > configs/scripts/my-script.agentscript
archastro deploy configs
# Script is now visible via: archastro describe script my-script
```

### Pull existing project and make changes
```
archastro init --enable-configs
archastro sync configs
# Edit files locally...
archastro deploy configs
```

### Quick edit via browser
```
archastro edit config ./configs/agents/my-agent.yaml
# Opens in browser with live validation
# Changes are saved to the server and synced back to the local file
```

## Response Rules

- Do not inspect or edit credential files directly — use the CLI only.
- Do not manually edit `.archastro-manifest.json` — use CLI commands.
- Do not ask the user to pick raw subcommands when intent is clear.
- Keep responses concise and operational.
- Always recommend `deploy configs` over individual `create config` calls when working with local files.
