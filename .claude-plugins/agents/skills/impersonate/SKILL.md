name: impersonate
description: Use when the user wants to impersonate an ArchAstro agent, asks about the active impersonation state, wants to refresh or stop impersonation, or refers to working as a specific ArchAstro agent inside Claude Code. Trigger phrases include "impersonate agent", "act as this agent", "be this agent", "start impersonation", "sync impersonation", "stop impersonation", "what agent am I impersonating", and "use the active agent identity".

# ArchAstro Agents Impersonation

Manage ArchAstro agent impersonation through the ArchAstro CLI and keep the Claude Code session aligned with the active identity file.

This skill depends on the `cli` plugin for CLI installation and authentication. Use that plugin's commands instead of trying to install or authenticate the CLI manually inside this skill.

## Core Workflow

1. Ensure the CLI layer is ready:
   - If the `archastro` command is missing, or the installed version is older than `0.3.1`, direct the user to `/cli:install`.
   - If authentication or app selection is missing, direct the user to `/cli:auth`.

2. Check the current impersonation state:
   ```
   archastro impersonate status --json
   ```

3. If the user wants to start impersonation and none is active:
   - run:
     ```
     archastro impersonate start <agent-or-flags>
     ```
   - then re-run:
     ```
     archastro impersonate status --json
     ```

4. If impersonation is active, read the `identity_file` from the returned state and adopt that identity for the current session while retaining your normal capabilities.

5. If the user wants to refresh impersonation:
   ```
   archastro impersonate sync
   ```
   Then re-run `archastro impersonate status --json` and re-read the identity file.

6. If the user wants to stop impersonation:
   ```
   archastro impersonate stop
   ```
   Then drop the impersonated identity from the current session.

## Response Expectations

- When impersonation is active, report the active agent, app, scope, and local file locations.
- When inactive, say so explicitly.
- If the CLI is missing or too old, route the user to `/cli:install`.
- If auth or app selection is missing, route the user to `/cli:auth` or supply `--app <id>`.
- Do not inspect or edit credential files directly. Use the CLI only.
