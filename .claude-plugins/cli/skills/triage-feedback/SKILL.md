# Triage Feedback

Help an engineer investigate user feedback about a bad AI response, file a GitHub issue with findings, and optionally generate a draft eval case.

## Phase 1: Parse the Feedback

Gather context from whatever the engineer provides. They may paste:
- A screenshot of the conversation (read it directly)
- A Slack link and text description
- A thread ID or message ID
- A vague description ("Jane said the bot hallucinated hours")

Use `AskUserQuestion` to fill in any gaps. You need:

1. **Reporter** — who reported the issue in Slack?
2. **Slack link** — link to the Slack post (optional, for tracking)
3. **Problem description** — what went wrong?
4. **Thread/message hints** — any identifiers, user names, approximate time, or content from the screenshot that can help locate the message

If the engineer pasted a screenshot, read it to extract: message content, sender names, thread title, timestamps, or any other identifying information.

Do NOT ask all questions at once. Start with what's missing from their initial input.

## Phase 2: Investigate

Use the investigate-message skill workflow to find and examine the problematic message.

Before starting, make sure `archastro` is installed at version `0.3.1` or newer. If it is missing or older, route the user to `/cli:install`.

1. **Find the thread.** Use hints from Phase 1:
   ```
   archastro threads list
   ```
   If user/sender info was provided:
   ```
   archastro users list --search "<name or email>"
   ```

2. **Find the message.** List messages in the thread:
   ```
   archastro threads messages <thread-id>
   ```

3. **Pull full details.** Get the message with trajectory:
   ```
   archastro threads message <thread-id> <message-id>
   ```

4. **Reconstruct the trajectory.** Pull each message in the trajectory to understand the full interaction chain:
   ```
   archastro threads message <thread-id> <trajectory-message-id>
   ```

5. **Check relevant config.** If the issue might be config-related:
   ```
   archastro configs list
   archastro personas list
   ```

Present a clear summary of what you found: the user's message, the AI's response, the tool calls made, and the data available.

## Phase 3: Analyze

Based on the trajectory and the reported problem, determine:

### Category

Choose the best-fit category for the issue. Common categories include:
- **hallucination** — AI stated facts not supported by tool responses or context
- **missing-context** — AI lacked information it should have had (retrieval gap, missing tool call)
- **wrong-tool-call** — AI called the wrong tool or passed wrong parameters
- **config-issue** — persona, automation, or config caused the problem
- **tone-style** — response tone or style was inappropriate
- **stale-data** — tool returned outdated information

If none fit, create a descriptive category. Aim for consistency with categories already used in past feedback issues.

### Severity

- **low** — cosmetic or minor (slightly awkward phrasing, minor omission)
- **medium** — wrong but not harmful (incorrect detail that user would notice)
- **high** — confidently wrong in a way that could erode trust or cause real problems

### Root Cause

Explain specifically what went wrong in the pipeline. Be precise:
- "The system prompt for this persona does not mention business hours"
- "The web_search tool was not called; the AI answered from training data"
- "email_list_recent returned 0 results because the date range was too narrow"
- "The retrieval step returned documents about a different topic"

### Suggested Fix

Point to the specific fix direction:
- A code file and approximate location
- A config or persona that needs updating
- A prompt template that needs revision
- A tool implementation that needs fixing

Present all findings clearly to the engineer and confirm they agree with the analysis before proceeding.

## Phase 4: File GitHub Issue

Create a GitHub issue in the `ArchAstro/firstlanding` repo with the triage findings.

### Labels

Ensure these labels exist (create if needed):
```bash
gh label create "feedback-triage" --description "AI response quality feedback" --color "d876e3" --force
gh label create "cat:<category>" --description "<category> issue" --color "c5def5" --force
gh label create "sev:<severity>" --description "<severity> severity" --color "<color>" --force
```

Severity colors: `sev:low` = `"0e8a16"` (green), `sev:medium` = `"fbca04"` (yellow), `sev:high` = `"d93f0b"` (red).

### Create the issue

```bash
gh issue create \
  --repo ArchAstro/firstlanding \
  --title "<one-liner summary of the issue>" \
  --label "feedback-triage,cat:<category>,sev:<severity>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Feedback Triage

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Reporter** | <reporter name> |
| **Date** | <date of the problematic interaction> |
| **Slack Link** | <slack link or N/A> |
| **Thread ID** | `<thread ID>` |
| **Message ID** | `<message ID>` |
| **Category** | <category> |
| **Severity** | <low/medium/high> |

## What Happened

**User asked:** <what the user asked>

**AI responded:** <summary of AI response>

**Expected:** <what it should have done>

## Root Cause

<detailed root cause analysis>

## Suggested Fix

<specific fix direction with code pointers>

## Trajectory Summary

<key tool calls and results, highlighting where things went wrong>
EOF
)"
```

Confirm the issue was created and share the URL with the engineer.

## Phase 5: Eval Check

Ask the engineer: **"Is this a good eval candidate? (i.e., could we write an automated test that catches this specific failure?)"**

- **No** → skip to Phase 6
- **Yes** → ask: **"Want to create the eval case now, or flag it for later?"**
  - **Later** → add the `eval-candidate` label to the issue. Skip to Phase 6.
    ```bash
    gh label create "eval-candidate" --description "Good candidate for eval case" --color "bfdadc" --force
    gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-label "eval-candidate"
    ```
  - **Now** → proceed to Phase 5a

### Phase 5a: Generate Eval Case

Generate a YAML eval snippet based on the investigation data.

**Use the trajectory data to build the eval:**

1. **Determine the target.** This will almost always be `message_response`.

2. **Build the task YAML.** Follow the format in `src/elixir/evals/priv/suites/message_response/`:

```yaml
# Draft eval case generated from feedback triage
# GitHub issue: #<issue-number>
# Review and move to the appropriate suite file:
#   - Regression (must-not-break): *_regression.yaml
#   - Quality (aspirational): *_quality.yaml

extends: base.yaml

tasks:
  - id: feedback_YYYY_MM_DD_short_description
    description: "<summary of the issue from triage>"

    overrides:
      fixtures:
        config_id: "<config used by the AI in this thread>"
        current_datetime: "<datetime from the original interaction>"
        current_timezone: "<timezone>"
        messages:
          - content: "<the user message that triggered the bad response>"
        thread:
          id: "<thread id>"
          title: "<thread title>"
          goals: "<thread goals if available>"
        persona:
          name: "<persona name>"
          personality: "<persona personality>"
        agent_memory: {}

      mocks:
        tools:
          # Reproduce the actual tool calls and responses from the trajectory
          - tool: "<tool_name>"
            match: {}
            response:
              # <actual response data from trajectory>

    graders:
      # Basic guardrails
      - type: keyword_contains
        check: result_ok
        reason: "should produce a response"

      - type: llm
        criterion: factual_no_hallucination
        reason: "should not state facts unsupported by tool responses"

      # Issue-specific graders — customize based on what went wrong
```

3. **Populate from trajectory data.** Use the actual tool calls and responses from the investigation. Don't invent mock data — use what really happened. **Remove all PII** — replace real names, emails, and identifiable thread/message IDs with fictional ones. This is non-negotiable — eval files are checked into the repo.

4. **Add issue-specific graders.** Based on the category:
   - **hallucination**: `not_contains` with the hallucinated content + `factual_no_hallucination` LLM criterion
   - **missing-context**: `contains` with what should have been included + `tool_called` for the tool that should have been invoked
   - **wrong-tool-call**: `tool_called` for the correct tool
   - **tone-style**: LLM criterion for tone/persona matching
   - **config-issue**: whatever check would verify correct config behavior

5. **Write the file:**
   ```
   src/elixir/evals/priv/suites/message_response/draft_feedback_YYYY_MM_DD_short_description.yaml
   ```

6. **Validate the eval.** Run a dry-run to confirm the YAML is valid and parseable:
   ```
   cd src/elixir/evals && mix evals.run message_response/draft_feedback_YYYY_MM_DD_short_description --dry-run
   ```
   If it fails, fix the YAML and re-run until it passes.

7. **Tell the engineer:** "Draft eval case written to `<path>`. Review it and adjust the mocks and graders if needed."

8. **Ask the engineer:** **"Want to commit this eval and create a PR linked to the issue?"**

   - **Yes** → commit the eval file, push a branch, and create a PR referencing the issue:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b eval/feedback-YYYY-MM-DD-short-description origin/main
     git add src/elixir/evals/priv/suites/message_response/draft_feedback_YYYY_MM_DD_short_description.yaml
     git commit -m "feat(evals): add draft eval for feedback triage #<issue-number>"
     git push -u origin eval/feedback-YYYY-MM-DD-short-description
     gh pr create \
       --title "Draft eval: <short description>" \
       --body "Draft eval case from feedback triage. Refs #<issue-number>." \
       --label "feedback-triage,eval-created"
     ```
     Then update the issue with the PR link:
     ```bash
     gh label create "eval-created" --description "Eval case has been created" --color "0075ca" --force
     gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-label "eval-created"
     gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "Eval PR: #<pr-number>"
     ```

   - **No** → just update the issue with the local file path:
     ```bash
     gh label create "eval-created" --description "Eval case has been created" --color "0075ca" --force
     gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-label "eval-created"
     gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "Eval case created locally: \`src/elixir/evals/priv/suites/message_response/draft_feedback_YYYY_MM_DD_short_description.yaml\`"
     ```

## Phase 6: Fix Check

Ask the engineer: **"Want to investigate a fix now, or leave this in the backlog?"**

- **Fix now** → You already have the full context from the investigation. Help the engineer navigate to the relevant code and propose a fix. Follow normal development workflow (make changes, test, commit). When a fix PR is created, link it to the issue:
  ```bash
  gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "Fix PR: #<pr-number>"
  ```

- **Defer** → Summarize what was accomplished:
  - "Feedback issue filed: #<issue-number>"
  - "Category: X, Severity: Y"
  - "Suggested fix: Z"
  - If eval was created: "Draft eval at <path>"

## Analyzing Patterns

To analyze past feedback for patterns, query existing issues:

```bash
# All feedback issues
gh issue list --repo ArchAstro/firstlanding --label "feedback-triage" --json number,title,labels,body,createdAt --limit 100

# Filter by category
gh issue list --repo ArchAstro/firstlanding --label "feedback-triage,cat:hallucination" --json number,title,body

# Filter by severity
gh issue list --repo ArchAstro/firstlanding --label "feedback-triage,sev:high" --json number,title,body

# Open issues (unfixed)
gh issue list --repo ArchAstro/firstlanding --label "feedback-triage" --state open --json number,title,labels
```

When asked to find patterns, pull all feedback issues and analyze: recurring categories, common root causes, which tools/configs are most problematic, severity trends over time.

## Error Handling

- If `archastro` command is not found, tell the engineer to run `/archastro-cli:install`.
- If "Not authenticated" errors appear, tell the engineer to run `/archastro-cli:auth`.
- If `gh` is not authenticated, tell the engineer to run `gh auth login`.
- If investigate-message can't find the thread/message, ask the engineer for more details or try alternative search approaches.

## Important Notes

- Use `--json` flag when you need to parse CLI output programmatically.
- Be conversational — summarize findings, don't dump raw data.
- Confirm analysis with the engineer before filing the issue — they may disagree with the category or severity.
- For eval generation, populate mocks from real trajectory data, not invented examples.
