# Install ArchAstro CLI

Install or upgrade the public `archastro` binary from Homebrew or GitHub Releases.

## Workflow

1. **Read the compatibility contract first**:
   - Use `plugin-compatibility.json` from the plugin root.
   - Prefer `plugins.archastro.minimumCliVersion`, fall back to the top-level `minimumCliVersion`.
   - Treat the resolved value as the minimum supported CLI version for every check below.

2. **Check whether the CLI is already installed**:
   ```
   archastro --version
   ```
   If this succeeds, record the version.

3. **If the CLI is present and meets the resolved minimum**, confirm the version and stop unless the user explicitly asked to upgrade.

4. **If the CLI is missing or older than the resolved minimum**, install it using the public distribution path:
   - On macOS, if Homebrew is available:
     ```
     brew install ArchAstro/tools/archastro
     ```
     If the formula is already installed, run:
     ```
     brew upgrade ArchAstro/tools/archastro
     ```
   - On Linux or macOS without Homebrew:
     ```
     curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArchAstro/archastro/main/install.sh | bash
     ```
   - On Windows PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArchAstro/archastro/main/install.ps1 | iex
     ```

5. **Verify installation**:
   ```
   archastro --version
   ```
   Confirm that the version now meets the resolved minimum.

6. **On failure, help troubleshoot the public install path**:
   - Missing `brew` is expected on Linux and some macOS setups; fall back to `install.sh`.
   - `Permission denied` usually means they need `--install-dir` or a user-writable target directory.
   - `command not found: archastro` after install usually means the install directory is not on `PATH`.
   - Release download failures usually mean the target release asset has not been published yet.

7. **On success**, tell the user the CLI is ready and suggest they run `archastro auth login` to authenticate.
